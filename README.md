# Virgin Pulse Animation Library
---------------------------------------

## Dependencies

The following external libraries are included in the bundled file:

- [Sketch.js](https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js): Animation framework for HTML5 canvas
- [css-beziers](https://github.com/davidaurelio/css-beziers): JavaScript implementation of CSS-style Bezier functions

## Installation

The simplest way to install this package is to use bower:
